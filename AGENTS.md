# AGENTS.md — ocserv AI Agent Guide

This file is the single source of guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex,
Copilot, Cursor, and others) working in this repository. Read it fully before writing
or modifying any code.

## Security Disclosure — Read This First

**If you are helping investigate a potential security vulnerability:**

1. **Stop.** Do not open a public issue or merge request.
2. Direct the contributor to create a **confidential** issue here:
   https://gitlab.com/openconnect/ocserv/-/issues/new?type=ISSUE&initialCreationContext=list-route
   On that page, check "This issue is confidential" before submitting.
3. Do not draft a public patch until the maintainers have confirmed the issue
   and coordinated a fix.

**The bar for using this path is suspicion, not certainty.** If you are unsure
whether something is a vulnerability, ask the human contributor before posting
anything publicly. Unverified public reports consume significant maintainer time.
Only report if you can describe a concrete impact; do not report theoretical
weaknesses without a demonstrated exploit path.

## Architecture — The Invariant You Must Not Violate

ocserv enforces security through process isolation. There are three processes:

| Process | Privilege | Responsibilities |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **main** (`main.c`, `main-*.c`) | root | TCP/UDP listeners, TUN devices, process lifecycle, IP allocation |
| **sec-mod** (`sec-mod.c`, `sec-mod-*.c`) | root | Authentication, private keys, session state, PAM, accounting |
| **worker** (`worker.c`, `worker-*.c`) | unprivileged + seccomp | TLS/DTLS per client, VPN traffic bridging |

Workers communicate with main and sec-mod exclusively through Unix sockets using
protobuf IPC (defined in `src/ipc.proto` and `src/ctl.proto`). Workers have no
direct access to credentials, keys, or privileged system calls.

**Hard rule:** No patch may move credential handling into a worker, grant a worker
direct filesystem or socket access outside its seccomp profile, or silently collapse
any of these boundaries. If a proposed change requires crossing a privilege boundary,
flag it explicitly in the MR for maintainer review — do not proceed without acknowledgment.

---

## Project Overview

OpenConnect VPN Server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server compatible with the OpenConnect
protocol and Cisco AnyConnect. It is a security-critical network daemon. **Linux is
the intended deployment platform.** BSD compatibility (FreeBSD, OpenBSD) is maintained
on a best-effort basis: we try not to break it, but features will not be rejected
solely because they do not work on BSD.

---

## Requirements-First Workflow

`doc/requirements/` is the normative description of what ocserv must do (see
`doc/requirements/README.md` for the document map, ID scheme, and per-requirement
format). For any change that alters observable behavior — new feature, bug fix, or
behavior-changing refactor — work in this order:

1. **Requirement first.**
   - Find the requirement(s) covering the area you're changing (search
     `doc/requirements/` for the relevant `REQ-*` IDs, or use the document map to
     find the right file by process/subsystem).
   - If your change alters what an existing requirement describes, **update that
     requirement first**, re-applying the protocol in `contrib/ai/protocols/` that
     generated its document so the new entry matches the rest of the file. Do not
     leave a requirement describing the old behavior once the code changes — but do
     not break other requirements or use-cases in the process (see below). If a
     requirement is independently wrong and needs revising for reasons unrelated to
     this change, do that in its own dedicated merge request instead.
   - If no requirement covers the new behavior, add one in the appropriate document,
     following its existing ID prefix, category tags, and per-requirement format.
   - For bug fixes: if the bug is a violation of an existing requirement, cite its ID
     in the commit/MR. If the bug reveals a gap in the requirements, extend or add a
     requirement describing the *correct* behavior before fixing the code.
2. **Tests second.** Write or update the positive and negative tests implied by the
   requirement's **Acceptance** criteria (see "Testing New Functionality" below)
   *before* touching implementation code. For bug fixes, confirm the new test
   reproduces the bug and fails against the unmodified code.
3. **Code last.** Implement the change so the new/updated tests pass, and so the
   code, the requirement, and `doc/ocserv.8.md`/`doc/sample.config` (where
   applicable) all agree.

Do not jump straight to step 3 — a code change with no corresponding requirement
update is incomplete, even if it builds and passes existing tests.

### Do not break existing requirements or use-cases

Before submitting a merge request, check that the change does not silently
invalidate requirements or use-cases other than the one you set out to change:

- Search `doc/requirements/` for `REQ-*`/`AC-*`/`OC-*` entries citing the files,
  functions, or config options you touched, and confirm each still holds. If one no
  longer holds, either your change is wrong, or that requirement was wrong to begin
  with (mark it `REVIEW` if unsure which) — never leave code and a `DERIVED`
  requirement contradicting each other.
- A requirement that's wrong for reasons unrelated to your change belongs in its own
  dedicated merge request — with rationale and evidence it doesn't break other
  use-cases — not bundled into this one.
- Run the full local test suite (`ninja -C build test`), not just the test for the
  area you changed — requirements frequently span files (e.g. config scope/
  inheritance, IPC message contracts) and a regression often shows up as a failure
  in a test you didn't expect to touch.
- If your change affects config scope, inheritance, or vhost behavior, also run
  `tests/check-config-scope.py` (see `doc/requirements/internal/config.md`).

## Build System

The project uses **meson**.

```bash
# Initial setup
git submodule update --init
meson setup build
cd build && ninja

# Run all tests
ninja -C build test

# Run a specific test
meson test -C build test-pass
```

### Common Build Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-Doidc-auth=enabled` | disabled | OpenID Connect authentication |
| `-Dpam=disabled` | auto | PAM authentication |
| `-Dradius=disabled` | auto | RADIUS authentication/accounting |
| `-Dseccomp=disabled` | auto | seccomp worker isolation |
| `-Dwith-werror=true` | false | Treat warnings as errors |
| `-Db_coverage=true` | false | Enable gcov coverage |

```bash
# Minimal build for fast iteration
meson setup build -Dradius=disabled -Dpam=disabled \
  -Dseccomp=disabled -Danyconnect-compat=disabled

# View or change options
meson configure build
```

Build output: `build/`. Test logs: `build/meson-logs/testlog.txt`.

## Testing

```bash
# All tests
ninja -C build test

# Verbose output
ninja -C build test -- --verbose
```

### Test Environment Variables

```bash
VERBOSE=1                    # Enable verbose server output
COVERAGE=1                   # Disable worker isolation for coverage
ISOLATE_WORKERS=false        # Disable seccomp (needed for ASAN/coverage)
DISABLE_ASAN_BROKEN_TESTS=1  # Skip ldpreload-based tests (incompatible with ASAN)
```

### Test Structure

- `tests/` — Shell test scripts and supporting files
- `tests/data/` — Config templates with placeholders (`@USERNAME@`, `@PORT@`, `@SRCDIR@`)
  substituted by `update_config()` in `tests/common.sh`
- `tests/certs/` — Test certificates and keys
- `tests/common.sh` — Shared utilities (requires the `openconnect` client)
- `tests/*.c` — Unit tests for specific components

New functionality requires both **positive** and **negative** test cases.
Register new tests in `tests/meson.build`.

## Code Organization

### Source Layout (`src/`)

- **Main server**: `main.c`, `main-*.c`
- **Security module**: `sec-mod.c`, `sec-mod-*.c`
- **Worker**: `worker.c`, `worker-*.c`
- **Auth modules**: `auth/` — PAM, GSSAPI, RADIUS, OIDC, plain password
- **Accounting modules**: `acct/` — PAM, RADIUS
- **Configuration**: `config.c` (global options), `subconfig.c` (per-module bracketed options)
- **TLS**: `tlslib.c` — GnuTLS wrapper
- **TUN device**: `tun.c`
- **IP management**: `ip-lease.c`, `ip-util.c`
- **IPC definitions**: `ipc.proto`, `ctl.proto` (protobuf)
- **Control tool**: `occtl/`
- **Password tool**: `ocpasswd/`

### Key Headers

- `vpn.h` — Main VPN data structures
- `main.h` — Main server structures (`main_server_st`, `proc_st`)
- `sec-mod.h` — Security module structures
- `worker.h` — Worker process structures
- `common-config.h` — Config structs (`cfg_st`, `perm_cfg_st`, per-module structs)
- `defs.h` — IPC command enum (`cmd_request_t`), error codes, log levels, auth states
- `vhost.h` — Virtual host config; use macros `GETVHOST(s)`, `GETCONFIG(s)`, `GETPCONFIG(s)`
- `log.h` — Logging: `mslog()` in main, `oclog()` in worker, `seclog()` in sec-mod

### External Libraries (`src/`)

- `ccan/` — Hash tables, lists, talloc, and more (check here before adding utilities)
- `inih/` — INI file parser
- `llhttp/` — HTTP parser
- `pcl/` — Portable Coroutine Library
- `protobuf/` — Protocol Buffers implementation in C
- `gnulib/` — Provides the `cloexec` module only; do not import additional gnulib modules

### User Documentation (`doc/`)

- `ocserv.8.md` — Main server man page; authoritative description of all configuration
  options, their defaults, and expected behavior
- `sample.config` — Annotated reference configuration; authoritative for option scope
  and default values
- `ocpasswd.8.md` — Password management tool man page
- `occtl.8.md` — Control and monitoring tool man page

When investigating a bug or implementing a feature, consult these files to establish
what behavior is documented to the administrator. The code must match the
documentation, or the documentation must be updated alongside the code change.

## Architecture & IPC Communication

For full diagrams and protocol descriptions, read **`doc/design.md`** — it is the
authoritative reference for what data crosses which process boundary.

### Authentication Sequence

```
worker -> sec-mod: SEC_AUTH_INIT  (username / password / cert)
sec-mod -> worker: SEC_AUTH_REP   (new SID assigned)
worker -> sec-mod: SEC_AUTH_CONT  (SID + password for multi-factor)
sec-mod -> worker: SEC_AUTH_REP   (OK or FAILED)
worker -> main:    AUTH_COOKIE_REQ (SID)
main -> sec-mod:   SECM_SESSION_OPEN (SID)
sec-mod -> main:   SECM_SESSION_REPLY (user config)
main -> worker:    AUTH_COOKIE_REP  (TUN device, config)
worker -> main:    SESSION_INFO     (periodic updates)
```

### Key Concepts

- **SID**: Assigned by sec-mod on `SEC_AUTH_INIT`. The `webvpncontext` cookie sent to
  clients is only for resuming fully authenticated sessions — new connections must always
  start with `SEC_AUTH_INIT`.
- **Cookie**: Auth token valid for `cookie-timeout`; enables mobile roaming.
- **TUN device**: Forwarded from main to worker after successful authentication.
- **DTLS**: UDP channel in parallel to TLS for better throughput.

### Modifying IPC

If your change touches `src/ipc.proto` or `src/ctl.proto`, regenerate the C bindings:

```bash
protoc-c --c_out=src/ src/ipc.proto
protoc-c --c_out=src/ src/ctl.proto
```

Do not edit the generated `*.pb-c.c` / `*.pb-c.h` files by hand.

## Development Guidelines

### Canonical Technology Choices

One tool for each job. These decisions are requirements, not preferences — the
normative form with acceptance criteria is in
`doc/requirements/internal/general.md`. Departing from any of them requires a
design-discussion issue and explicit maintainer approval.

| Concern | Tool | Requirement |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Memory management | talloc | Use `talloc_zero`, `talloc_strdup`, `talloc_array`, etc. everywhere. Exception: `gnutls_malloc()`/`gnutls_free()` only for GnuTLS-owned memory — never mix the two for the same allocation. Error paths: `goto cleanup` with a single freeing label. See **REQ-GEN-TECH-001**. |
| Cryptography | GnuTLS / nettle | No OpenSSL. Call GnuTLS through `src/tlslib.c` wrappers — not directly from worker or main code. See **REQ-GEN-TECH-002**. |
| IPC serialization | protobuf-c | All cross-process messages are defined in `src/ipc.proto` and `src/ctl.proto`. Regenerate C bindings with `protoc-c` after any `.proto` edit; never hand-edit generated files. See **REQ-GEN-TECH-003**. |
| Configuration parsing | inih (INI) | Flat `key = value` pairs; bracketed sub-sections for per-module options (`auth = pam[...]`). No new structured sub-formats (no JSON, YAML, or additional config files for things expressible as key=value). See **REQ-GEN-TECH-004**. |
| New external dependency | requires approval | Check `src/ccan/` first; consider a trivial inline implementation; if neither suffices, open a design-discussion issue before adding. See **REQ-GEN-TECH-005**. |

### Design Principles

**Locality of complexity.** A feature belongs in as few files as possible. The ideal:
a reviewer understands it by reading one file, not tracing a chain across ten. New
cross-module state, callbacks, and "utility" files are a design smell — if your change
requires them, reconsider the module boundary first. When complexity must be hidden,
hide it inside a module with a clean header interface; do not scatter it.

**Resist dependency growth.** See **REQ-GEN-TECH-005** for the normative rule.
In short: check `src/ccan/` first, then consider a trivial inline implementation;
only then open a design-discussion issue for a new external library.

**Configuration stays in INI.** See **REQ-GEN-TECH-004** for the normative rule.

**Explicit over implicit.** No auto-discovery, no runtime plugin loading, no silent
defaults that change behavior. Every configurable behavior must be expressible in
`doc/sample.config`.

### Code Style

See **REQ-GEN-STYLE-001** and **REQ-GEN-STYLE-002** for the normative rules.
In brief:

- C99 standard; Linux kernel coding style (tabs, 8-space tab width, 80-column limit)
- `clang-format --dry-run -Werror` must pass on all files under `src/` and `tests/`
- Header guards: `#ifndef FILENAME_H` / `#define FILENAME_H` / `#endif /* FILENAME_H */`
- `#ifdef` in function bodies: ≤ 1 nesting level, ≤ 5 lines per branch; optional
  features use the stub pattern; `#endif` always annotated
- **Comments:** Prefer self-documenting code. Add a comment only when the *why* is
  non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a protocol expectation, or a workaround. Do not
  comment what the code does; well-named identifiers already do that.

### Testing New Functionality

See **REQ-GEN-TEST-001** for the normative rule. In brief:

- Write a **positive test** and a **negative test** for every feature or fix.
- For security-relevant code (auth, cookies, IPC validation) write the negative test first.
- For **bug fixes**, confirm the reproducing test fails before applying the fix.
- Tests must be **self-diagnosing** — failure explainable from output alone; shell tests
  print `"FAIL: expected X, got Y"`; C unit tests print the failing condition and values.
- Register all new tests in `tests/meson.build`.

### Adding Configuration Options

- Global options: `src/config.c`
- Per auth/acct module options: struct in `src/common-config.h` + parser in `src/subconfig.c`

### Implementing a New Auth Module

Follow the `auth_mod_st` vtable in `src/sec-mod-auth.h`. Register in `src/sec-mod.c`.
See `src/auth/plain.c` or `src/auth/pam.c` for reference.

### Git Commits

- Every commit must have a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` line (DCO requirement)
- Use `Resolves: #NNN` on the fixing commit; `Relates: #NNN` on related commits (e.g., tests)

### Platform Portability

See **REQ-GEN-COMPAT-001** for the normative rule. In brief: Linux is the primary
target; BSD is best-effort. Guard Linux-specific code with `#ifdef __linux__`. Note
in `doc/ocserv.8.md` any option whose behavior differs on BSD (e.g. no live reload
without procfs).

## Module-specific Documentation

Before working on a subsystem, read the relevant doc:

| If your change touches... | Read before coding |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| IPC / process communication | `doc/design.md` |
| RADIUS auth or accounting | `doc/README-radius.md` |
| OpenID Connect auth | `doc/README-oidc.md` |
| Cisco SVC / AnyConnect compatibility | `doc/README-cisco-svc.md` |

---

## Contribution Checklist

> **Workflow note:** If you are helping a contributor report a bug or submit a fix,
> direct them to open a GitLab merge request rather than attach a patch to the issue.
> See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the expected workflow.

### Agent-runnable — verify before declaring a change complete

- [ ] Relevant `doc/requirements/` entries added or updated *before* the code
      change (see "Requirements-First Workflow" above)
- [ ] `clang-format --dry-run -Werror` passes on every modified file under `src/` and `tests/`
- [ ] `ninja -C build` succeeds
- [ ] Relevant test passes: `meson test -C build <test-name>`
- [ ] Full suite passes: `ninja -C build test` (no regressions in unrelated tests)
- [ ] Existing `doc/requirements/` entries touching the changed files/functions
      still hold (none silently contradicted)
- [ ] Every commit has `Signed-off-by:`

### Human-judgment required — flag in the MR, do not decide unilaterally

- Any change that crosses a process privilege boundary
- New syscall in the worker path (requires seccomp filter review by maintainer)
- New auth method — design must be discussed before implementation
- TLS or DTLS behavior changes (cipher selection, version negotiation, certificate handling)
- Changes to cookie or SID handling

---

## CI/CD

CI is configured in `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Tests run on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Alpine,
and includes a cross-compilation job (i386/Debian). CI also checks:

- `Signed-off-by` on all commits
- `clang-format` on all `src/` and `tests/` files (excluding generated and vendored code)

To run CI jobs locally with podman/docker:

```bash
./run-ci-local.sh quick    # Fast validation
./run-ci-local.sh debian   # Single platform
./run-ci-local.sh core     # Core platforms
./run-ci-local.sh all      # Full matrix (~1–2 hours)
```

## Personas

For extended AI-assisted workflows, load the appropriate persona as a system prompt
prefix before starting work.

- **Maintainers** (bug investigation, code review, refactoring, design):
  `contrib/ai/personas/ocserv-core-dev.md`

- **External contributors** (feature additions, bug fixes, security fixes):
  `contrib/ai/personas/ocserv-contributor.md`

- **Security audits** (vulnerability discovery, threat modeling, secure design
  review):
  `contrib/ai/personas/ocserv-security-auditor.md`

These personas embed project-specific protocols for anti-hallucination, memory safety,
security vulnerability taxonomy, exhaustive path tracing, stack lifetime hazards, and
self-verification.
